        <p>Ripple is a venture-backed startup that provides global financial
          settlement solutions that reduce the total cost of settlement by enabling
          banks to transact directly and instantly, while ensuring certainty. It
          aims to "enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges
          information—giving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV).” Over time, ripple
          has expanded its customer base across geographies by adding some of the most
          reputed banks and financial institutions as its partners.

      </header>
      <article>
        <p>Hurricane Irma is barreling up the Sunshine State, bringing heavy rainfall
          and powerful winds. The deadly hurricane, which is now a Category 2 storm with
          sustained winds of 100 miles per hour, was moving east of the Tampa metro area.
          Millions of Floridians are under orders to evacuate, and many are desperately
          seeking shelter from the storm. One Naples resident told ABC News she was turned
          away from two shelters before she and her 10-year-old son were finally accepted at one.

        <h1>What is robots.txt</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>Robots.txt is a file used to give instructions to web robots. it helps web owners to
          reduce the amount of web robots that scan the web if the owner doesnt want to, since web robots
          usually check the robot.txt file before it checks your website. This can be configured
          by adding a robots.txt file to the root folder of your project and that includes a "User-agent" that
          decides which robots the file apply to. This is followed by a "Disallow" in which one can determine
          which, if not all, parts of the website the web robot can visit.

        <p>Open graph is a technology that allows a user of a social media integrate with a website while

          <h1>Why different files fo css and html</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p> First of all, having different files for the design and content can be more efficient and clearer and better
            structure. It is also easier for developers when writing diferent pages with the same style. Instead of having
            to write the design again and again, one can use the same file for several pages. Another advantage is that it allows
            browsers to cache the .css files which makes loading time faster.
